# Peer-to-Peer Delivery Platform

This project is a peer-to-peer delivery marketplace inspired by ride-sharing models, where travelers (carriers) transport small personal items for senders across cities or countries using their unused baggage capacity.

The platform connects:
- **Travelers**, who post trips and earn money by carrying items
- **Senders**, who request deliveries and pay securely via escrow
- **Admins**, who ensure trust, compliance, and dispute resolution

The system focuses on:
- Secure handovers using OTP / QR verification
- Escrow-based payments with platform commission
- Identity verification and risk controls
- Clear audit trails and status-driven workflows

This repository represents the **MVP architecture and implementation**, designed to be scalable, compliant, and production-ready.
